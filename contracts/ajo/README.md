# Ajo Smart Contract

> Trustless rotating savings circle (Ajo/Esusu) on Stellar Soroban.

The contract manages the full lifecycle of a savings circle: member enrollment, per-cycle contributions, and automatic rotation payouts — all without a trusted intermediary.

## Overview

An Ajo circle works as follows:

1. An admin deploys and initializes the contract with circle parameters.
2. Members join by calling `join`, which locks their first contribution.
3. Once the circle is full, it starts automatically (cycle 1 begins).
4. Each cycle, all members call `contribute` to pay into the pot.
5. After `cycle_interval_secs` has elapsed, the admin calls `payout` to send the full pot to the current cycle's recipient.
6. Steps 4–5 repeat until every member has received a payout, at which point the circle is marked `completed`.

## Lifecycle

```
[Uninitialized]
      │ initialize()
      ▼
  [Waiting]  ← members call join()
      │ last member joins (circle full)
      ▼
  [Cycle 1]  ← members call contribute()
      │ payout() called after next_payout_time
      ▼
  [Cycle 2]  ← members call contribute()
      │ payout() called after next_payout_time
      ▼
     ...
      │ payout() on final cycle
      ▼
  [Completed]
```

State transitions are enforced by the contract — there is no admin escape hatch to skip or reverse a cycle.

## Initialize Parameters

| Parameter            | Type      | Constraints              | Description                                              |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `admin`              | `Address` | Must sign the call       | Platform address authorized to trigger payouts           |
| `token`              | `Address` | —                        | USDC token contract address on the network               |
| `contribution_amount`| `i128`    | > 0                      | Per-member per-cycle amount in stroops (1 USDC = 10⁷)   |
| `max_members`        | `u32`     | 2 – 20                   | Total members = total cycles                             |
| `cycle_interval_secs`| `u64`     | —                        | Seconds between payouts (e.g. `2592000` = 30 days)       |

`initialize` can only be called once. Subsequent calls panic with `"already initialized"`.

## Public Functions

### `initialize(env, admin, token, contribution_amount, max_members, cycle_interval_secs)`

Sets up the circle. Stores all parameters and emits an `initialized` event.

### `join(env, member)`

- Requires `member` auth.
- Transfers `contribution_amount` from `member` to the contract (first cycle contribution).
- Records the contribution for cycle 1.
- Panics if: circle already started, circle is full, or member already joined.
- When the last member joins, sets `current_cycle = 1` and `next_payout_time = now + cycle_interval_secs`.

### `contribute(env, member)`

- Requires `member` auth.
- Transfers `contribution_amount` from `member` to the contract for the current cycle.
- Panics if: circle not started, not a member, or already contributed this cycle.

### `payout(env)`

- Requires `admin` auth.
- Panics if: circle not started, already completed, or `ledger.timestamp < next_payout_time`.
- Sends `contribution_amount × max_members` to the member at position `current_cycle - 1` (0-indexed).
- Advances to the next cycle or marks the circle completed.

### `get_state(env) → (current_cycle, max_members, next_payout_time, completed)`

Read-only. Returns the four key state values.

### `get_members(env) → Vec<Address>`

Read-only. Returns all member addresses in join order.

### `upgrade(env, new_wasm_hash)`

- Requires `admin` auth.
- Replaces the contract WASM with the uploaded hash.
- Emits an `upgraded` event.

## Storage Layout

All state is stored in **instance storage** (persists for the contract's lifetime).

| `DataKey::CycleIntervalSecs`     | `u64`             | Seconds between payouts                          |
| `DataKey::Members`               | `Vec<Address>`    | Members in join order                            |
| `DataKey::CurrentCycle`          | `u32`             | 0 = not started; 1..N = active cycle             |
| `DataKey::NextPayoutTime`        | `u64`             | Ledger timestamp after which payout is allowed   |
| `DataKey::Contributions(addr,n)` | `bool`            | Whether `addr` has contributed for cycle `n`     |
| `DataKey::Completed`             | `bool`            | True after the final payout                      |

## Security Model

### Trust assumptions

- **Admin is trusted to call `payout` on time.** The contract enforces the time lock (`next_payout_time`) but cannot self-trigger. The platform backend (cron job) is responsible for calling payout after each window.
- **Token contract is trusted.** The contract calls `token::Client::transfer` directly. Only use audited USDC contracts.
- **Members must approve the contract.** Soroban's auth model requires each member to sign `join` and `contribute` calls. The contract cannot pull funds without the member's signature.

### What the contract enforces

- Double-initialization is blocked.
- Double-contribution per cycle is blocked.
- Early payout (before `next_payout_time`) is blocked.
- Payout after completion is blocked.
- Only the admin can trigger payouts and upgrades.
- Member count is capped at 20 to bound gas costs.

### What the contract does NOT enforce

- Member identity (any Stellar address can join).
- Off-chain NGN contributions via Paystack — those are reconciled by the backend before the on-chain `contribute` call.
- Slashing for missed contributions — the current version does not penalize defaulters on-chain.
